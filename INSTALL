This module provides you with a Pod2HTML converter and a manual for
Graph::Easy.

To install this module type the following:

Untar the package:

	tar -xzf Graph-Easy-Manual-0.19.tar.gz

Change into the directory:

	chdir Graph-Easy-Manual-0.19/

Verify the package:

	cpansign --verify

If the package fails to verify, do NOT run Makefile.pl nor install it and
notify me immidiately. YOUR SYSTEM MIGHT GET COMPROMISED! 

When the package verified okay, then proceed:

        perl Makefile.PL

If you get warnings about missing or outdated modules, then
upgrade/install these first. Then run the testsuite:

        make test

If all tests pass, install the package:

        sudo make install

in your favourite browser.

You can also give optional an output path:

	./gen_manual --output/path/to/output

Run:

	./gen_manual --help

to get help about other options.
