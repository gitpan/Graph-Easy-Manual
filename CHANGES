Revision history for Graph::Easy::Manual:

2006-02-21 v0.31 Tels 2 tests - Doc, doc, doc, document the code...
  * regen from Graph::Easy 0.42
  * add FAQ and tutorial
  * fix a few broken links and add some small explanations
  * add more examples and images (minlen, joints, colors, unicode)
  * complete redesign of the menu structure:
    + move three menu items to submenus
    + get rid of container-<p>'s by making <a> as "display: block"

    The background of these changes is:
    + The menu got too long, cutting of most entries on systems with 800x600
    + Hovering over a menu-item could only color the text, not the background,
      since the <a> was not as big as the container-<p> with the border
    + the base.css file shrunk from 3520 bytes to 2985, and we save a couple
      hundred bytes on each page in the menu
